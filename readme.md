# Praktiki for AXIS

[The AXIS Extension](https://www.github.com/tylernygrendc/the-axis-extension) introduced new functionality to [The Joint Chiropractic's](https://www.thejoint.com/our-story) combined health record and customer management system (AXIS). The scope of that project, however, was limited to automation of front-of-house tasks. Praktiki for AXIS is a revitalized effort at reshaping medical documentation within the The Joint's clinic system. This project replaces The AXIS Extension.
